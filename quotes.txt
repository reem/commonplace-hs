It’s worth questioning whether the circular investment dynamic actually works.
Can that really be self-sustaining? Can things work out when no one is thinking
of substantive things to do or adding new ideas into the system? The era of
indefinite optimism is arguably coming to an end. Look at government bonds,
which are essentially the purest version of money. Yields keep going down.
People keep holding because they don’t know what else to do. Today you can earn
1.8% on a government bond. But expected inflation is 2.1%. The expected return
over the next decade is -0.3%. You get negative returns when people run out of
ideas.
Indeterminacy has reoriented people’s ideas about investing. Whereas before
investors actually had ideas, today they focus on managing risk. Very rarely in
the hedge fund world do people ask questions about what’s going to happen in
the future. It’s less, “What should we do?” and more, “How do we manage risk?
Yet again, process trumps substance.

Anti-science activism and statistics-illiterate fear-mongering are killing
millions of people. It's shocking and horrifying to realize how many
completely-preventable deaths happen every year due to unnecessary fear of
20th-century inventions. Sometimes, the legitimate science in favor of a
beneficial technology is so crushingly overwhelming that I have to call
opposition to it tantamount to mass murder.

I feel very strongly about this. Well-intentioned activists and media
fear-mongering are making large swathes of the public into unwitting
participants in a vast global calamity of scientific-illiteracy. It is outright
killing millions of people.

"When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and
your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into
the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money.
That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one
simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people
that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you
can build your own things that other people can use.
Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again."

instead of 64 distinct great-great-great-great-great grandparents you'd have

As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power
continuum, he knows he's looking down. Languages less powerful than Blub are
obviously less powerful, because they're missing some feature he's used to. But
when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the
power continuum, he doesn't realize he's looking up. What he sees are merely
weird languages. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub,
but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. Blub is good enough for

when a recursive solution doesn't apply and see if you can use that as an edge

For now, let's examine how you would get the first 24 multiples of 13. Sure,
you could do [13,26..24*13]. But there's a better way: take 24 [13,26..].
Because Haskell is lazy, it won't try to evaluate the infinite list immediately
because it would never finish. It'll wait to see what you want to get out of
that infinite lists. And here it sees you just want the first 24 elements and
it gladly obliges.

Your First Time Wasn’t Gentle

I learned to code when I was 7, fiddling on my grandfather’s computer on long,
boring suburban summers. I learned BASIC, made a ball dance on screen. I
learned Pascal and wrote a program to play back music on the PC speaker. I
learned C around age 10, but hit a pretty big wall there that I dodged around
until high school: pointers. Even ignoring those damnable pointers, I worked
and read and studied and practiced and failed a whole lot. I deleted my
grandfather’s hard drive twice (once by accident), and ended up reinstalling my
OS more than a few times. I failed, over and over.

Maybe your story is similar, maybe it’s wildly different. But I think nearly
everyone who learned to program can relate to the difficulty of the process.
And then, after learning the basics, we again encounter well-known conceptual
thresholds like “pointers.” Many computer science professors describe pointers
as a kind of filter in their curricula. If you are going to be a good
programmer, you must be able to understand pointers. And the people who easily
learn them are few and far in between. Most people, myself included, needed
practice and examples to understand what pointers were and why they were
important.

This nearly universal struggle isn’t a coincidence. Pointers are a very
powerful and fundamental abstraction. Learning them makes you a better
programmer by helping you think more symbolically. Even if you work in a
language that doesn’t offer you pointers, pointer-like structures and concepts
abound in the wild.

You don't.  You go right ahead and "force your cultural views on other people."
We've arrived into some weird bizarro point in human space-time where we're
knee-jerking against ages of our ancestors forcing their ideals on others and
the exact opposite -- the fear of making a rational cultural judgment -- is
causing a great deal of harm as well.

I know people love to operate from some perceived absolutist position (i.e. "we
shouldn't judge" or "God has determined the nature of morality"), but the truth
is, we're either our own salvation or our own annihilator.  It's always been up
to us.  It's always fallen to those with solid common sense to say, "Let's just
wait a second and evaluate this a little more thoroughly."

And the truth is, there is no fixed rule.  There is no position of permanence
or static comfort from which we get to say, "This is here, forever, it will
never change.  We no longer have to evaluate it."  That is the recourse of
simple, lazy minds.  We get no such comfort in our universe.  And even if there
were "fixed" rules--based on what "God says"--it's not like they've been any
help anyway.  Religion and unbending rules have always been broken and--worse
still--exploited by those with enough intelligence to use the immovability of
society's norms as a hiding place for their nefarious plans.

How easy would it be to just relax and say, "Nope.  Don't have to think/worry
about that anymore.  God says 'no'!  The rules say, 'can't happen'."  So, like
with everything in the universe, this subject requires a bit of rational
thought.  And the rational thought may be:  we don't have to fret about making
judgments, one is called for in this case and we shouldn't be afraid of it or
afraid to shout it wherever we go.

It's wrong.  People who do it are wrong.

I think that you have science mixed up with Sophism. Science's job description
doesn't call for being able to defend any position you hand it. That's for
lawyers. Science's job description calls for being able to distinguish real
things from false things, as measured against the unblinking jurisprudence of
reality. The only "argument" science favors is physical evidence.
For which there is, effectively, none in favor of reincarnation. The only
pieces of evidence offered for reincarnation are anecdotes:
impossible-to-verify stories that always evaporate whenever they do present the
kinds of information that could be verifiable. Cf Bridey Murphy.
Science isn't about arguing for it. It's about coming up with evidence. If one
wanted to scientifically demonstrate reincarnation, one would presumably follow
up every story and try to find one that isn't a hoax, wishful thinking, or
self-delusion. You'd work very hard to disprove each story, and it's only when
you found a number of stories that you couldn't disprove, then you'd have
something. The more confirmable details, the better. And you have to try very
hard to confirm all of the details, because when somebody else manages to
disprove one, you'll have a very hard time getting anybody to pay attention to
you ever again.
Science doesn't, in fact, always live up to its ideal of
hypothesis-test-reevaluate. Scientists have limited time, money, and attention,
and so they focus their efforts on things that seem most productive. That means
that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proofs: so many of
reincarnation stories have proven to be false that you're going to have to put
together an airtight case with tremendous details in order to get anybody to
spend their own time and resources checking your work out.

The answer to pretty much every "Is X Diet scientific" question is "no".

And it's true in this case as well. Your body has a mechanism for controlling
its pH. If it's working, you don't need to do anything with your diet. If it's
not working, you won't be able to fix that with your diet; in fact, you'd have
far worse problems and you'd need to get to a doctor ASAP.

To the degree that these diets promote the same advice nutitionists have been
giving for decades (more greens, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, less
highly processed crap) then the diets can help. But their reasoning is
completely off base, and will cause you to miss perfectly healthy diet choices
while overdosing on some things you don't need.

Mostly, I'd like to see the Highly Alkaline Diet people meet up with the Apple

People have offered to let them teach creationism in a comparative religion
class, one which doesn't endorse any particular religion, though this would be
fraught with difficulties. No matter, since the creationism proponents aren't
really interested in comparative religion. Partly, that's because they don't
really want religion taught in an objective way, but more importantly, their
children are already taught creationism at home. The real goal is to discredit
evolution.

Evolution is seen as the atheist religion, and they're afraid that their
children are being indoctrinated in it. They want that refuted, right there in
the science class. There isn't any actual scientific evidence to support them
on that. All they've got are creationist textbooks with misleading examples
that they claim can't have evolved. They're wrong about that, which doesn't
matter in a religion class (where correspondence with reality is not a
requirement) but it does if you want to put it in a science class. 

Which is what they want, since they're afraid that school will trump their
at-home teachings. So they keep trying to put in their religion as some kind of
alternative to science, and the courts keep throwing it out. That's a cycle
that can continue indefinitely.
