Welcome Noble Warrior,

The Shadows have invaded the Brain, and the Commonplace Coalition has decided
to sent you to fight the menace. We cannot afford to adequately equip you, so
you will have to salvage for yourself.

We also require you to gather the wisps of thought that the shadows have taken.
The Brain is complex, and it has several categories of wisps that the shadows
have specialized in and taken. Collect them and enrich yourself.

Most importantly, you must slay the King of Shadows, who has as of yet
destroyed every warrior we sent to fight him. He currently lounges in the
Throne of Mathematics, which is deep inside the Brain. Find him and slay him.

Go wander the halls of the Brain and slay the shadows, warrior!
